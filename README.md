# IPL-Winning-Team-Prediction_using_Machine_Learning

The aim of this project is to predict the  winning teams of IPL match 2021 on a  given a set of features as inputs. Input variables are team 1 , team 2 ,city And the output variable is winner. We are dealing only with winner. We have winner   between two team. The higher the value the better is winner. In this project we will treat each team  separately and their aim is to be able and find the winner of the match that work well for new unseen data. These are the classifiers.
Our IPL dataset contains match by match records from the first match played in the 2008 season till the complete 2020 season.
 In this project we are explaining the steps we followed to predict winner of IPL 2021, the study of data to extract knowledge and insights from the data and apply knowledge and actionable insights. In this project, we will work on IPL Data Analysis and Visualization Project using Python where we will explore interesting insights from the data of IPL matches like most run by a player, most wicket taken by a player, and much more from IPL season 2008-2020. We will initially perform simple statistical analysis and then slowly build to more advanced analysis
